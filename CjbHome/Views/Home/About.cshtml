<p>
    I am a software developer based in Brisbane, Australia. I have previously lived and worked in Sydney and Amsterdam, Netherlands.
    My work has focused mainly on the Microsoft stack and has covered both desktop and web applications development.

    I am also a husband and a dad. I enjoy travelling, hiking, camping and taking my 4WD out on the beach. I love football and am a keen Aston Villa supporter.
